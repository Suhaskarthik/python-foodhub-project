<img width="942" alt="image" src="https://github.com/thaychansy/python-foodhub-project/assets/161902555/526a9157-75d9-4a1d-8d28-5d814de3146a">

# Project Overview

The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.

# Objective

The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business. 


# Conclusions 

The Meatball Shop has the highest average rating with 4.51 stars and 119 rating count.

Shake Shack is a strong contender with a 4.27 rating and a much larger pool of rating count at 195.

Blue Ribbon Sushi at 4.22 stars as the average rating is quite popular as well.

American food are among the most popular cuisine type.

Shake Shack has the highest weighted demand, which considers both average rating and number of ratings (195 ratings at 4.27 average rating). This suggests that Shake Shack is likely the most popular restaurant among the provided ones.

# Recommendations

Analyze negative reviews to identify areas for improvement: Pay attention to what customers don't like and address those issues to improve their experience.

Promote positive aspects based on cuisine type: Since American food appears to be popular, highlight the unique aspects of your American cuisine to stand out from competitors.

Encourage more reviews for restaurants with lower rating count: Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews to increase visibility and build trust with potential customers, especially for restaurants with a lower rating count. This can be done through in-store signage, email requests, or social media campaigns.

Overall, these insights can help restaurants improve their customer experience and attract more customers. By understanding customer preferences and addressing any shortcomings, restaurants can create a more positive dining experience that will keep customers coming back.
